Buses are the integral means of transport sources in India. 
In metropolitan cities, over millions of people travel through public transport every day.
The major problem faced by the passengers is unnecessary waiting time at stations. 
Hence to overcome this, tracking of a vehicle is much necessary. 
Because of the accuracy and affordability, GPS technology has become one of the most popular solution for such applications. 
On the other side, smart payment is trending everywhere. 
Smart payment can offer an easy and convenient automated bill payment system.
Implementing this in transportation, would help the passengers to travel even when they donâ€™t have enough cash with them. 
This project mainly deals with developing a website which will help in smart transport and smart payment system. 
Tracking and fetching of the location of a bus is done using GPS system. 
This helps in knowing the location of vehicle, which in return helps in proper planning and managing time. 
The tracking of the bus is done using the GPS system, by which the passenger can come to know the location of that particular bus in which he desires to travel by entering the required information in the website.
Smart payment is also done through the website developed in this project, where a passenger needs to sign in and enter the required information for the payment. 
This will even help in displaying the balance amount in his account.

In order to start the server, run the app.js file.
The python codes bus_locations.py and rfid.py are used to update location and for authenticity of RFID number respectively. 
These 2 python codes should be running simultaneously when the server is ON.
